# Curator web


####Step 1: First, you will need to install node, npm and webpack
Install node from https://nodejs.org. This will also install npm

    npm install webpack -g
    npm install webpack-dev-server -g (optional)

####Step 2: Install all the required node modules
    cd curator-web
    npm install

####Step 3. Package application

	webpack
  webpack --progress --colors --watch

####Step 4. Run the express server

    npm start
    open http://localhost:5000/ #This is where your app is running
In dev mode express will run using webpack middleware. Check

##### Karma tests
# Do not use your global installation if it is not the exact version in package.json
node_modules/karma-cli/bin/karma start

### Day to day dev
cd to curator-web
run the following in different console tabs
    npm start
    webpack --progress --colors --watch
    node_modules/karma-cli/bin/karma start

This will free you up from having to keep starting and restarting app, webpack-ing and karma tests

###For those who are starting new
You will need to install git. I recommend using brew.
Install brew from http://brew.sh/
Your computer will ask to install Xcode if you donâ€™t have it already. Install it.
Once brew is installed, run:

    brew install git

cd to your projects folder:

    git clone https://github.com/rajeshnaroth/curator.git
    cd curator/curator-web
    npm install
    webpack
    npm start
    open http://localhost:5000/

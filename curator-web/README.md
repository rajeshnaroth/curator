# Curator web


## Step 1: First, you will need to install node, npm and webpack
Install node from https://nodejs.org. This will also install npm

    npm install webpack -g
    npm install webpack-dev-server -g

## Step 2: Install all the required node modules
    cd curator-web
    npm install

## Step 3. Package, Run the express server and test
cd to curator-web and run:
    npm start

open http://localhost:5000/ This is where your app is running

In dev mode express will run using webpack middleware. It also includes hot module reloading.
Not very useful in the beginning I should admit.

### Karma tests
Do not use your global installation if it is not the exact version in package.json
Run:
    node_modules/karma-cli/bin/karma start


## For those who are starting new
You will need to install git. I recommend using brew.
Install brew from http://brew.sh/
Your computer will ask to install Xcode if you donâ€™t have it already. Install it.
Once brew is installed, run:

    brew install git

cd to your projects folder:

    git clone https://github.com/rajeshnaroth/curator.git
    cd curator/curator-web
    npm install
    npm start
    open http://localhost:5000/
